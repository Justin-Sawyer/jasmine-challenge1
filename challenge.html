    <h1>Jasmine Testing</h1>
    <h2>Red-Green-Refactor</h2>
    <p>Develop code incrementally.</p>
    <p>Start by writing code that fails (red!), then just enough to make it pass (green!).</p>

    <h2>The challenge:</h2>
    <p>Drink About is a simple function that will check the age and return a drink appropriate for your age. 
    Create a function called whatCanIDrink. This function should take in age as parameter. The function should do the following:</p>
    <br>
    <p>If the age is less than 0, then it should return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"</p>
    <p>If the age is less than 14, then it should return "Drink Toddy"</p>
    <p>If the age is less than 18, then it should return "Drink Coke"</p>
    <p>If the age is less than 21, then it should return "Drink Beer"</p>
    <p>If the age is less than 130, then it should return "Drink Whisky"</p>
    <p>Else return "Sorry. I can’t tell what drink because that age is incorrect!"</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What am I testing for?</h3>
    <p>Am I testing for age?</p>
    <p>Yes... but age is what decides what I can drink.</p>
    <p>Am I testing for the drink?</p>
    <p>Yes. The drink I can consume is a result of what age I am.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thus, the function should start with asking what I can drink, and have age as its parameter.</p>
    <p>What can I drink? -&gt That depends on my age -&gt If I am this age, I can drink that.</p>
    <p>So, the parameter "age" must be filled in. It must not return "undefined"</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Programming defensively</h2>
    <p>What can break the code?</p>
    <p>If the age value is not a Number, the code should return an alert.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What if the age is less than 0 or greater than 130?</p>
    <p>These are values of the age parameter. A result should be returned, but not as an Error.</p>
